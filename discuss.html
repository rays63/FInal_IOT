        <div class="para">
          <p>Cloud computing is an approach of how to access the general pool of customizable computer systems (e.g. networks, servers, storage systems, applications and services) on-demand network quickly and with little administrative effort or involvement between internet services. In addition to these three key features, the cloud community has widely used the three service models listed below to categorize cloud services:
            <ul>
              <li>Encrypt your data</li>
                <p>Storing your images and files with a provider that relies on encryption will give hackers pause. It’s easier for them to steal data that hasn’t been scrambled.</p>
              <li>Perform data backups</li>
              <p>You might consider backing up your most sensitive information in your own external hard drives even if you are saving it in the cloud.</p>
              <li>Have a secure password</li>
                <p>If you have a Secure and hard to guess passwords the hackers can't easilly hack into your system.A Secure Password is long, contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.You can also use a unique password created by a random password generator and it is easy to remember.</p>
              <li>Enable two-factor authentication</li>
                <p>You can make life more difficult for hackers by enabling two-factor authentication. As the name suggests, two-factor authentication requires you to provide two pieces of information when logging onto a site.</p>

          <h2 class="content-title">Advantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
          <p>Cloud-based software provides several benefits to businesses of all sizes, including the flexibility to access software from any device, whether through a native app or a browser.Here are some of the advantages of Cloud computing:
            <ol>
              <li>Back-up and restore data</li>
                <p>Once the data is stored in the cloud, it is easier to get back-up and restore that data using the cloud.</p>
              <li>Improved collaboration</li>
                <p>Cloud applications improve collaboration by allowing groups of people to quickly and easily share information in the cloud via shared storage.</p>
              <li>Excellent accessibility</li>
              <p>Cloud allows us to quickly and easily access store information anywhere, anytime in the whole world, using an internet connection. An internet cloud infrastructure increases organization productivity and efficiency by ensuring that our data is always accessible.</p>
              <li> Unlimited storage capacity</li>
              <p>Cloud offers us a huge amount of storing capacity for storing our important data such as documents, images, audio, video, etc. in one place.</p>
            </ol> 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column col-right reveal">
          <h2 class="content-title">Disadvantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
          <p>While rules push cloud computing businesses to strengthen their security and compliance procedures, the problem persists. Encryption safeguards critical information, but if the encryption key is lost, the data is gone forever. These are the major disadvantages of Cloud Computing:
            <ol>
              <li>Internet Connectivity</li>
              <p>As you know, in cloud computing, every data (image, audio, video, etc.) is stored on the cloud, and we access these data through the cloud by using the internet connection. If you do not have good internet connectivity, you cannot access these data. However, we have no any other way to access data from the cloud.</p>
              <li>Limited Control</li>
              <p>As we know, cloud infrastructure is completely owned, managed, and monitored by the service provider, so the cloud users have less control over the function and execution of services within a cloud infrastructure.</p>
              <li>Security</li>
              <p>Although cloud service providers implement the best security standards to store important information. But, before adopting cloud technology, you should be aware that you will be sending all your organization's sensitive information to a third party, i.e., a cloud computing service provider. While sending the data on the cloud, there may be a chance that your organization's information is hacked by Hackers.</p>

      <div class="para">
        <p>As there the developers have been developing and securing there servers and trying to full all the pothole so the cloud computing can be more secure and powerful there are still some hidden vulnerabilities which the developers have not been able to cover up and find the companies have been appoint the best of the best security personals to make the cloud computing as secure as possible.It is hard to penetrate the cloud servers but still not impossible to penetrate as there have been case on the data breaches  and data loss that the big companies have had these are some of the examples of the cloud data breach and data loss :
          <ul>
            <li>Data Breach</li>
            <p>A data breach is a security event in which sensitive, private, or confidential information about a person or organization is accessed, copied, or sent by an unauthorized party. A data is breached when confidential material has been seen or obtained by unauthorised persons. There may be cyberattacks performed with data breach as their primary goal.Data breach is a high-risk danger that is ranked first among cloud computing threats. In 2017, about 1.4 billion records were lost due to data breaches, many of which included cloud servers. </p>
            <li>Data loss</li>
            <p>It is the destruction or unavailability of data caused by natural catastrophes such as floods and earthquakes, as well as simple human errors such as when a cloud administrator mistakenly deleted files, hard drive failure, power failure, or malware infection. To avoid data loss, the most effective method is to backup data to many places, so that if data becomes damaged or destroyed in one location, it may be replaced with a copy accessible in another site.</p>
