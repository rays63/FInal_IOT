        <p>According to a survey by Ermetic, nearly 80% of businesses have experienced at least one cloud data breach in the last 18 months, while 43% of businesses report more than 10 breaches.According to the 300 CISOs surveyed, the three biggest causes of breaches were:</p>

      <div class="para">
        <p>Cloud computing is an approach of how to access the general pool of customizable computer systems (e.g. networks, servers, storage systems, applications and services) on-demand network quickly and with little administrative effort or involvement between internet services. In addition to these three key features, the cloud community has widely used the three service models listed below to categorize cloud services:
          <ul>
            <li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
            <p>SaaS is a software distribution and licensing model in which software is accessed online via a subscription rather than purchased and installed on individual machines.</p>
            <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
            <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete cloud development and deployment environment with resources to create everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled business systems.</p>
            <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
            <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service in which businesses rent or lease computers in the cloud for compute and storage. Users can run any operating system or application on the rented servers without incurring maintenance or running charges.</p>

      <div class="para">
        <p>As there the developers have been developing and securing there servers and trying to full all the pothole so the cloud computing can be more secure and powerful there are still some hidden vulnerabilities which the developers have not been able to cover up and find the companies have been appoint the best of the best security personals to make the cloud computing as secure as possible.It is hard to penetrate the cloud servers but still not impossible to penetrate as there have been case on the data breaches  and data loss that the big companies have had these are some of the examples of the cloud data breach and data loss :
          <ul>
            <li>Data Breach</li>
            <p>A data breach is a security event in which sensitive, private, or confidential information about a person or organization is accessed, copied, or sent by an unauthorized party. A data is breached when confidential material has been seen or obtained by unauthorised persons. There may be cyberattacks performed with data breach as their primary goal.Data breach is a high-risk danger that is ranked first among cloud computing threats. In 2017, about 1.4 billion records were lost due to data breaches, many of which included cloud servers. </p>
            <li>Data loss</li>
            <p>It is the destruction or unavailability of data caused by natural catastrophes such as floods and earthquakes, as well as simple human errors such as when a cloud administrator mistakenly deleted files, hard drive failure, power failure, or malware infection. To avoid data loss, the most effective method is to backup data to many places, so that if data becomes damaged or destroyed in one location, it may be replaced with a copy accessible in another site.</p>
