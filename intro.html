        <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.Cloud computing is the usage of different services on the internet for performing operations such as storing, managing and processing data on a common storage that can be accessed from anywhere rather than one particular system. Instead of being stored directly on your own personal device, cloud-based data is stored on servers owned by companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google and is made accessible to you via the internet. Whether you are accessing your Gmail or streaming your movies through Netflix or listening to your favourite songs on Spotify, you are a customer of a cloud services provider.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-text">The US Defense Department has canceled the $10 billion JEDI cloud computing project it awarded to Microsoft in 2019, saying the controversial program’s design “no longer meets its needs.” The department will replace JEDI with another cloud infrastructure contract and plans to solicit bids from Microsoft as well as Amazon — which sued over losing the original contract.<br><br>
              CNBC reported the news earlier today. “Due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs,” reads a Defense Department press release sent to The Verge. “JEDI was developed at a time when the department’s needs were different and both the CSPs technology and our cloud conversancy was less mature,” said acting Defense Department chief information officer John Sherman as part of the statement.</p>

This includes containers, database, and compute, to build a portfolio of new digital financial services to bring advanced banking experiences to customers. This includes online accounts that can be opened in under six minutes and instant digital payments, helping the bank increase customer satisfaction by 35 per cent and lower costs by 24 per cent.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-text">We reached a big milestone in 2020: Cloud services revenue finally surpassed enterprise spending on data centers, according to the Synergy Research Group. One of the longest-running trends in IT – moving to the cloud – has been turbocharged, driven in part by a pandemic that pushed enterprises to avoid the logistical challenges and capital expense of deploying on prem.<br><br>But the endless capacity to add horsepower without provisioning your own infrastructure isn’t the biggest draw. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have become launchpads for the latest technology innovations, which developers can jump on to build innovative new applications. Machine learning libraries? Globally distributed databases? IoT platforms with all the bells and whistles? The big three clouds have ‘em all – ready, waiting, and API-accessible. It’s enough to make you wonder why you’d bother to build and maintain your own datacenter.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-text">The old saying, “Water water everywhere, not a drop to drink,” is so apt. When you are in the middle of an ocean surrounded by water all around but because of the salinity of the water, you are unable to drink it. The same can be extended to the amount of data available today. I draw a corollary from this saying and modify it in the context of the data — “Data data everywhere, not a place to store.”<br><br>With the percolation of internet in the lives of all and the rapid digitisation across the world, it has practically become impossible to have a tape storage, magnetic storage or any mode of storage to be sufficient enough to cater to the needs of data storage and further its processing. Gone are the days when you were required to have the data with you for you to use it. Today is the era of cloud storage and data availability is “on-the-go.”</p>

          <h2 class="content-title">Advantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
          <p>Cloud-based software provides several benefits to businesses of all sizes, including the flexibility to access software from any device, whether through a native app or a browser.Here are some of the advantages of Cloud computing:
            <ol>
              <li>Back-up and restore data</li>
                <p>Once the data is stored in the cloud, it is easier to get back-up and restore that data using the cloud.</p>
              <li>Improved collaboration</li>
                <p>Cloud applications improve collaboration by allowing groups of people to quickly and easily share information in the cloud via shared storage.</p>
              <li>Excellent accessibility</li>
              <p>Cloud allows us to quickly and easily access store information anywhere, anytime in the whole world, using an internet connection. An internet cloud infrastructure increases organization productivity and efficiency by ensuring that our data is always accessible.</p>
              <li> Unlimited storage capacity</li>
              <p>Cloud offers us a huge amount of storing capacity for storing our important data such as documents, images, audio, video, etc. in one place.</p>
            </ol> 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column col-right reveal">
          <h2 class="content-title">Disadvantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
          <p>While rules push cloud computing businesses to strengthen their security and compliance procedures, the problem persists. Encryption safeguards critical information, but if the encryption key is lost, the data is gone forever. These are the major disadvantages of Cloud Computing:
            <ol>
              <li>Internet Connectivity</li>
              <p>As you know, in cloud computing, every data (image, audio, video, etc.) is stored on the cloud, and we access these data through the cloud by using the internet connection. If you do not have good internet connectivity, you cannot access these data. However, we have no any other way to access data from the cloud.</p>
              <li>Limited Control</li>
              <p>As we know, cloud infrastructure is completely owned, managed, and monitored by the service provider, so the cloud users have less control over the function and execution of services within a cloud infrastructure.</p>
              <li>Security</li>
              <p>Although cloud service providers implement the best security standards to store important information. But, before adopting cloud technology, you should be aware that you will be sending all your organization's sensitive information to a third party, i.e., a cloud computing service provider. While sending the data on the cloud, there may be a chance that your organization's information is hacked by Hackers.</p>
