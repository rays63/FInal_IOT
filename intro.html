        <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.Cloud computing is the usage of different services on the internet for performing operations such as storing, managing and processing data on a common storage that can be accessed from anywhere rather than one particular system. Instead of being stored directly on your own personal device, cloud-based data is stored on servers owned by companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google and is made accessible to you via the internet. Whether you are accessing your Gmail or streaming your movies through Netflix or listening to your favourite songs on Spotify, you are a customer of a cloud services provider.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title" style="margin-top: 35px;">Types of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <div class="para">
          <p>Yes the data in the Cloud can be secure but still there is the posibility of hackers hacking into the cloud and steal your data. The cloud can be more secure that the data kept in the hardisk of your own pc as the hackers and hack into your system in many ways and steal your data.The data that you save with cloud service providers may likely be safer than the information you've stored in your computer's hard drive. Hackers can use malware and phishing emails to get the information stored on your own devices. They might freeze your computer, demanding a ransom before they'll release the files and data they've frozen. It is secured by the companies providing the services but there are still precausion that the user can take inorder to fully secure the data in the cloud. Here are some ways to do so:
            <ul>
              <li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
                <p>SaaS is a software distribution and licensing model in which software is accessed online via a subscription rather than purchased and installed on individual machines.</p>
              <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
                <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete cloud development and deployment environment with resources to create everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled business systems.</p>
              <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
                <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service in which businesses rent or lease computers in the cloud for compute and storage. Users can run any operating system or application on the rented servers without incurring maintenance or running charges.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-text">The US Defense Department has canceled the $10 billion JEDI cloud computing project it awarded to Microsoft in 2019, saying the controversial program’s design “no longer meets its needs.” The department will replace JEDI with another cloud infrastructure contract and plans to solicit bids from Microsoft as well as Amazon — which sued over losing the original contract.<br><br>
              CNBC reported the news earlier today. “Due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs,” reads a Defense Department press release sent to The Verge. “JEDI was developed at a time when the department’s needs were different and both the CSPs technology and our cloud conversancy was less mature,” said acting Defense Department chief information officer John Sherman as part of the statement.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-text">Amazon Web Services, (AWS), the cloud computing arm of e-commerce giant Amazon said that Axis Bank, India’s third-largest private sector bank, has selected AWS to accelerate its digital transformation program and meet the growing demand for its digital banking services.<br><br>As part of a multi-year agreement, Axis Bank will draw on the breadth and depth of AWS services. This includes containers, database, and compute, to build a portfolio of new digital financial services to bring advanced banking experiences to customers. This includes online accounts that can be opened in under six minutes and instant digital payments, helping the bank increase customer satisfaction by 35 per cent and lower costs by 24 per cent.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-text">We reached a big milestone in 2020: Cloud services revenue finally surpassed enterprise spending on data centers, according to the Synergy Research Group. One of the longest-running trends in IT – moving to the cloud – has been turbocharged, driven in part by a pandemic that pushed enterprises to avoid the logistical challenges and capital expense of deploying on prem.<br><br>But the endless capacity to add horsepower without provisioning your own infrastructure isn’t the biggest draw. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have become launchpads for the latest technology innovations, which developers can jump on to build innovative new applications. Machine learning libraries? Globally distributed databases? IoT platforms with all the bells and whistles? The big three clouds have ‘em all – ready, waiting, and API-accessible. It’s enough to make you wonder why you’d bother to build and maintain your own datacenter.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-text">The old saying, “Water water everywhere, not a drop to drink,” is so apt. When you are in the middle of an ocean surrounded by water all around but because of the salinity of the water, you are unable to drink it. The same can be extended to the amount of data available today. I draw a corollary from this saying and modify it in the context of the data — “Data data everywhere, not a place to store.”<br><br>With the percolation of internet in the lives of all and the rapid digitisation across the world, it has practically become impossible to have a tape storage, magnetic storage or any mode of storage to be sufficient enough to cater to the needs of data storage and further its processing. Gone are the days when you were required to have the data with you for you to use it. Today is the era of cloud storage and data availability is “on-the-go.”</p>
